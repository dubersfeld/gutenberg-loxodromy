# gutenberg-loxodromy
I present here a microservice-oriented application that is a Docker version of the previous project [gutenberg-allegro](https://github.com/dubersfeld/gutenberg-allegro). This project uses an ElasticSearch Docker image instead of the local ElasticSearch service that should be stopped to avoid any port conflict. In addition I present an emulation of an ElasticSearch cluster based on Docker containers.  The only change from gutenberg-allegro is the removal of RestTemplate from frontend-server and its replacement by WebClient as a RESTful client. This change takes into account the future deprecation of RestTemplate.
